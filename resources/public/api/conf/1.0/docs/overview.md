<p>This API provides individual's income information (PAYE only) from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Income data is only available for tax years commencing 2013-2014.</p>

<p>The responses exclude fields when they do not have a value.</p>

<p>This API is a HAL HATEOAS RESTful API, designed to promote discoverability and to be self documenting.</p>

<p>A HATEOAS API makes it clear to client software what can be done when an action is completed, i.e. what you need to know when you need to know it. New functionality can be added without breaking your client software.</p>

<p>This API is still under development; many enhancements are planned and we strongly recommend following the HATEOAS approach from the outset, so as to protect your development effort from forthcoming change.</p>

<p>You are advised to follow links as they are presented to you in the API at runtime. This prevents you from building state into your client and decouples you from changes to the API.</p>

<p>The default Media Type for responses is hal+json.</p>
