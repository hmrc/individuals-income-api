Data is only available for the current and previous 6 tax years.

Self Assessment data is only available for taxpayers who are registered for Self Assessment, and who sent a Self Assessment tax return in the relevant time period.

Self Assessment data may not be available for the most recent tax year because of the deadlines for sending tax returns. For example, the deadline for sending a tax return for the 2019-20 tax year was 31 October 2020 for a paper return, and 31 January 2021 for sending online.
